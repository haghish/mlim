Title: Extreme Missing Data Imputation With Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)
Version: 0.0.1
Author: E. F. Haghish
Maintainer: E. F. Haghish <haghish@uio.no>
Description: Using automated machine learning, the package fine-tunes an Elastic 
    Net (ELNET) or Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model for imputing the missing 
    observations of each variable. This procedure has been implemented for the 
    first time by mlim package and is expected to outperform other packages for 
    imputing missing data that do not fine-tune their models.
