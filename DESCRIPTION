Description: Using automated machine learning, the package fine-tunes an Elastic 
    Net or Gradient Boosting Machine model for imputing the missing 
    observations of each variable. This procedure has been implemented for the 
    first time by this package and is expected to outperform other packages for 
    imputing missing data that do not fine-tune their models.
