`mlim` : Extreme Missing Data Imputation with Automated Machine Learning
========================================================================

In reccent years, there have been several attempts for using machine learning for missing data imputation. Yet, `mlim` R package is unique because it is the first R package to implement automation for missing data imputation. In other words, `mlim` implements automated machine learning and brings the state-of-the-arts of this technique, which is expected to result in imputation with lower imputation error compared to other standard procedures of missing data imputation.
